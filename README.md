# TF2-Dodgeball

Yet Another Dodgeball Plugin

This project was made due to Yet Another Dodgeball plugin being incredibly old and being terribly oudated.

If you live in a metric unit country and want to use the km/h please just use the tf2_dodgeball-metric plugin.
If you live in a imperial unit country or want to use the original, use the tf2_dodgeball plugin.

A wiki will be setup detailing the config for the plugin.

# Features

- Dodgeball Admin Menu: Allows you to change max rockets, change rocket speed (although it is somewhat buggy), set a main rocket class, and lets you reset configurations mid-game.
- Pyrovision support
- Beep to new target when a redirected rocket occurs
- Steal and delay prevention systems
- Speedometer
- Accurate mph and deflection counter on kill
- Disable tauntkilling straight from the plugin
- Airblast Prevention toggle command (To allow for some fun for players which choose it)
- Km/h version for those that live in metric countries.
